Here, I put the files with minor changes. (bug fix)
And also I put ipython files to make augmentations that I wote.

NOTICE:
Before using this program, you need to make folders like './image/train/type1' to './image/train/type6'.

How to use:
python licensePlateType.py -t train -n int(number) -p int((1~6 for each type) or 7(all types))
