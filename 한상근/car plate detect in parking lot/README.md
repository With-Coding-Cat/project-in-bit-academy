The purpose of main project was to track specific car by reading car plate while cars' are driving.
But there were some difficulties to read accurately.

First. Lack of real data.
- Even I made a lot of artificial data with noises and augmentation, still there are differences between real data and artificial data. Especially when there is motion blur because of fast speed of car, detection becomes more difficult.

Second. Lack of hardwear's performance.
- When we take pictures of cars, because of lack of performance of camera (or smart phone), even we cannot distinguish the car plate's characters. Not only resolution matters, but also motion blur was the main problem.

So my team decided to make car plate reader for parking lot first,
In this case, we can control the speed of car (to stop) and resolution of target(plate). Even FPS is not the primary issue anymore.
So here, I made GUI for car plate reader for parking lot(not for real. only by using video files).

I put codes what I wote myself in Personal Folder, and integrated version in GUI folder.
